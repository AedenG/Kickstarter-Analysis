# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends for Louise.
  
Louise, an up-and-coming playwright, requests advice regarding starting her first crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play Fever. She would like to create a play in the U.S. with a budget of $10,000+. She is also interested in researching musicals in Great Britain with a budget of 4000 pounds.
    
 The most successful category of Kickstarter campaign is theater.

 The most successful month of the year to begin a Kickstarter campaign is in May.

 The $10,000 goal for a US play should ideally be reduced since successful US campaigns typically have lower campaign goals (closer to $5,000) and failed US campaigns typically have higher campaign goals (closer to $10,000).
 
 
In Great Britain, the mean successful campaign goal is ~4000 pounds. I recommend that you aim to have your play produced for less than 4000 pounds.
