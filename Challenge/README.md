# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

My client, Louise, originally requested advice regarding starting her first crowdfunding Kickstarter campaign to help her fund her play *Fever*. After presenting the data, she launched a campaign for her play *Fever*, and it quickly came close to reaching its fundraising goal. Louise would now like to understand the outcomes of different campaigns in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. I will present the data to Louise using Kickstarter data.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

 A pivot table and line graph were created using data from Kickstarter to visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates. The pivot table rows include theater project launch dates, presented in months. The columns include successful, failed, and canceled projects, as well as the total number of projects.

 The line graph includes project launch dates, present in months on the x-axis and number of successful, failed, and canceled projects on the y-axis.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

Using Kickstarter data, a table and line graph were created to compare the funding goal amounts versus the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays. The table rows show ranges of funding goals. The columns show number of successful projects by outcome, as well as total projects. The table columns also include percentage of each outcome.

The line graph was created with ranges of funding goals on the x-axis and percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays on the y-axis.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

While analyzing the data for outcomes based on launch date, I noticed the number of projects launched were not equal and the number of cancelations tended to occur most often in January. Using percentages of successful, failed, and canceled projects helped to verify the conclusions I drew from the original pivot table and graph.

## Results

### Two conclusions drawn about the Outcomes based on Launch Date:

The most successful Kickstarter theater projects are launched between May to July.
The least successful time to launch a campaign is in October and December.

### Conclusion drawn about the Outcomes based on Goals:

The most successful plays had funding goals of less than $5,000. Looking at the line graph, it is evident that plays with funding goals less than $5,000 have a higher percentage of successful projects, as well as a lower percentage of failed projects.

### Limitations of this dataset/possible tables and/or graphs:

Looking back at the data for outcomes based on launch dates, data regarding percentage of successful, failed, and canceled outcomes would have been helpful to further analyze the data. A table and line graph displaying this data would add to my available information to be able to further advise Louise.


Expanding the dataset to include more data from plays with higher funding goal ranges of $25,000+, if this information is available, would also be helpful. I notice that the highest number of fail rates have some of the least amount of data. Funding goal range $45,000-49,999 has only one project, which failed. This can skew the data.
